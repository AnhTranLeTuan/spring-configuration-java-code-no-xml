# Spring core: Configuration with Java Code only

## Description
Experiment with concepts of inversion of control and dependency injection without going through the XML file. In this project, we can see how classes will be marked as beans, how we can activate component scan on these classes, as well as how we can data from the properties file with just Java code.
